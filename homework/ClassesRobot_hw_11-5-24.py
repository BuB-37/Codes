Worker Robots build structures, while Medic Robots heal injured citizens. Create a Robot class with a skill() method. Derive WorkerRobot and MedicRobot classes from Robot, each with a specific skill. Use recursion to display the skills of both types of robots.\nInstructions:\nDefine a Robot class with a skill() method that returns the robotâ€™s unique skill.\nCreate WorkerRobot and MedicRobot classes that inherit from Robot, overriding the skill() method to return the specific skill of each robot.'''"}]
